## Current Game State

As of 7/16/20, the project has been marked complete and submitted to Weekly Game Jam 157. Additional edits after this point were file clean up/size reduction for the purposes of uplaoding to GitHub. The final project is available on [itch.io](https://piptastic.itch.io/toggle).

Players must try to earn points while avoiding enemy fire - only a single hit will end the game. 

If a player can't avoid a bullet, or is overwhelmed by enemies they can't shoot down, there's an easy solution - just toggle invincibilty. Unfortunately, when players turn invicnible, so do all the enemies.

It might sound appealing to stay invincible, but doing so will not progress the game. To earn points, players must either shoot down enemies or capture points. Enemies are invincible when the player is, and capture points only progress when the player is vulnerable.

On game end, players can view their total score, their high score, and decide if they want to give it another shot.
